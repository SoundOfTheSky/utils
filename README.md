`npm i @softsky/utils`

__ZERO DEPENDENCIES__ utils library. Test coverage __100%__.

Usual utils plus more obscure stuff that I've never seen in any library. 
Also fancy TypeScript generics and types that I often use.

## Signals
Reactive signals

__function__ `signal` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Signal can hold any data (except functions),
when this data has changed any effects containing
this signal will be rerun.

```ts
const $mySignal = signal<number|undefined>(1) // Create signal with initial value 1
$mySignal(5) // Set to 5
$mySignal(undefined) // Set to undefined
$mySignal(prev=>prev+1) // Increment
// Will print signal on change
effect(()=>{
console.log($mySignal())
})
```

---
__function__ `effect` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Effects are simplest way to react to signal changes.
Returned data from handler function will be passed to it on next signal change.
Returns a function that will clear the effect.


// Will print signal on change
effect(()=>{
console.log($mySignal())
})
// Use previous state as a reference
effect((last)=>{
const mySignal = $mySignal()
if(last>mySignal) console.log('Increment!')
return mySignal;
})

---
__function__ `untrack` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Untrack helps to not react to changes in effects.
```ts
const $a = signal(1)
const $b = signal(2)
// Will only run on changes to $b
effect(()=>{
console.log(untrack($a)+$b())
})
```

---
__function__ `derived` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Creates a derived reactive memoized signal.

```ts
// Sum of all changes of $a()
const { signal: $sumOfTwo, clear: clearSum } = derived((value) => value + $a(), 0)
```

---
__function__ `batch` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Batches multiple edits, so they don't call same effects multiple times

```ts
const $a = signal(1)
const $b = signal(2)
effect(()=>{
console.log($a()+$b())
})
$a(2); // Prints 4
$b(3); // Prints 5
// Prints only 10
batch(()=>{
$a(5);
$b(5);
})
```

---
__function__ `when` - __SIGNALS SYSTEM__

Returns ImmediatePromise that is resolved when check function returns truthy value.
If you want to, you can resolve or reject promise beforehand.

```ts
await when(() => $a()>5)
// With timeout
const promise = when(() => $a() > 5)
const timeout = setTimeout(() => promise.reject('Timeout')}, 5000)
primise.then(() => clearTimeout(timeout))
```

---


## Time
Timers, CRON, etc.

__function__ `measurePerformance` - Measure performance of a function

---
__function__ `setSafeTimeout` - Original setTimeout and setIntval known for accumulating delay
and causing problem with timeouts bigger than 32bit integer.

This timeout wrapper fixes them. Returns clear function.

---
__function__ `setSafeInterval` - Original setTimeout and setIntval known for accumulating delay
and causing problem with timeouts bigger than 32bit integer.

This interval wrapper fixes them. Returns clear function.

---
__function__ `cronInterval` - Like setInterval but with cron.
Returns clear function.
For cron string syntax check __getNextCron()__ description

---
__function__ `getNextCron` - Find next cron date after passed date. This function __DOES NOT__ implement regular CRON 1 to 1.

1. [0-999] Milliseconds
2. [0-59] Seconds
3. [0-59] Minutes
4. [0-23] Hours
5. [1-31] Dates
6. [1-12] Months
7. [0-6] Weekdays

Main differences:
- Weekdays value only 0 to 6 (0 is Sunday)
- New supported syntax: __30-60/10__ - means __30,40,50,60__
- Second and millisecond support: __0,500 300__ - every 30 seconds, two times

---
__class__ `SpeedCalculator` - Object that calculates speed, ETA and percent of any measurable task.

`push()` chunks into speed calculator and then read `stats` for results.
`size` - a target then task is finished. Without it only speed is calculated.
`historyTime` - is a time period based on which speed will be calculated.

---

---
__type__ `Prettify` - Visual only overhaul. Shows final type result on hover.

```ts
type a = {a: '1'}
type b = Prettify<a & { b: 'b' }>
// On hovering b it will show
type b = {
a: "1";
b: "b";
}
// instead of
type b = a & {
b: "b";
}
```
